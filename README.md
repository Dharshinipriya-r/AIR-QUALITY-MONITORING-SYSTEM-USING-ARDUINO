# AIR-QUALITY-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
Now-a-days air pollution is one of the most important concern of the world. Air pollution may evolve from anthropogenic or natural sources.
Air pollutants of atmospheric substances like CO, CO2, SO2, NO2, and O3 suspended particulate matter (SPM), repairable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a great effect on the people health. 
India is worldâ€™s eighth most polluted country in the world. Therefore measuring Air Quality is an important element for bringing lot of awareness among the people. 
Based on this, Government of India has already taken certain measures to ban Single Stroke and Two Stroke Engine based motorcycles which are emitting high pollutions comparatively. 
We have also used easiest platform like Thing speak and set the dashboard to public such that everyone can come to know the Air Quality at the location where the system is installed. 
Thus to develop a real time air quality and pollution monitoring system is critical. We have developed an arduino based air pollution detector which combined a small-sized, minimum-cost sensor to an arduino microcontroller unit.
This system will continuously monitor the  harmful gases available in a closed environment.
